                    This is a specially pleasant woodland that has an extensive forest road network that provides for some great walks. 
                    Situated on the eastern end of Slievenamuck hill, there are a wide variety of tree species present for the walker 
                    to enjoy including some impressive stands of Scot’s pine and old woodland restoration sites which favour oak and other native species.
                    One may wish to explore further into the forest and seek out Moore’s Rock, a promontory that offers beautiful views of the Galty mountains 
                    and the rich farmland that lies at the base of the Glen of Aherlow. For the more energetic walker, it is possible to walk to the Millennium 
                    Monument at the top of Cordangan or there are options to follow forest roads along the Slievenamuck ridge to Christ the King statue.
